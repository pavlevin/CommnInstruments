<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
This module provides a number of Cisco-specific extensions to the Cisco AJAX XMPP Library.
</p>

<br/>

<br/>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>
To install this module, copy the "jabberwerx.cisco.js" file into the same directory that contains "jabberwerx.js" and "jabberwerx.ui.js". Then modify your HTML pages to load "jabberwerx.cisco.js" after "jabberwerx.js" or "jabberwerx.ui.js".

<h2>Quick Contacts</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
The quick contacts feature provides support for managing temporary subscriptions to other contacts. This support is provided via a controller (jabberwerx.cisco.QuickContactController) and a model (jabberwerx.cisco.QuickContact). The controller provides methods for subscribing to, and unsubscribing from quick contacts. The model provides a Contact-based reprenstation of a QuickContact, allowing most other features of the Cisco AJAX XMPP Library to operate on QuickContacts as if it were another person in the roster.
</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>
To use QuickContacts, create a QuickContactController:
<pre class="code">
    var quickCtrl = client.controller.quickContact ||
                    new jabberwerx.cisco.QuickContactController(client);
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Once the client is connected, to add a quick contact, call QuickContactController's <tt>subscribe(jid)</tt> method:
<pre class="code">
    quickCtrl.subscribe("user-a@example.com");
    var contact = client.entitySet.entity("user-a@example.com");
</pre>
There should now be an entity for "user-a@example.com" in the client's entitySet. Usually this will be an instance of "jabberwerx.cisco.QuickContact". Now all presence changes for that contact are evented through the standard "resourcePresenceChanged" and "primaryPresenceChanged" events.
</p>

<p>
To remove a quick contact, call the entity's <tt>remove()</tt> method:
<pre class="code">
    contact.remove();
</pre>
Alternatively, a quick contact can be removed by JID via the QuickContactController's <tt>unsubscribe(jid)</tt> method:
<pre class="code">
    quickCtrl.unsubscribe("user-a@example.com");
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Once the client disconnects, all quick contacts are removed from the client's entitySet.
</p>

<h3>Interaction with Roster</h3>
<p>
The quick contacts feature is meant to supplement the core roster features. As such, certain methods may behave slightly differently to accomodate roster-based contacts:
<ul>
    <li><tt>QuickContactController.subscribe</tt> may not always create QuickContact entities. If subscribing to an "observer" roster contact (e.g. a contact that the user does not receive presence for, but that contact receives the user's presence), the existing contact entity is updated to indicate there is also a temporary presence subscription.</li>
    <li><tt>QuickContactController.unsubscribe</tt> may not always destroy QuickContact entities. If unsubscribing from an "observer" roster contact (e.g. a contact that the user does not receive presence for, but that contact receives the user's presence), the existing contact entity is updated to indicate there is no longer a temporary presence subscription.</li>
    <li>Any attempts to subscribe to a durable roster contact (e.g. a contact which the user already has a persistent presence subscription to) are denied with an exception. The reason for the exception is to explicitly inform the user that a QuickContact subscription could not be made. It is up to the developer using the library to check for a roster contact that isn't a 'to' or 'both' subscription before attempting a <tt>QuickContactController.subscribe</tt>.</li>
    <li>Quick contacts can be promoted to roster contacts by adding the quick contact to the user's roster. All temporary subscription data is maintained until the roster contact's persistent subscriptions are established.</li>
</ul>
